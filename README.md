Cardball is a sports simulation game in which each player is dealt 5 playing cards from a shuffled pack. 
To play the game, each player is required to sort the cards in their hand and play them in descending order of value. 
After each player has played a card, the player who played the card with the highest value is awarded a goal. 
If more than one player plays the highest valued card, then no goal is scored in that round.
